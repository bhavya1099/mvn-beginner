================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No Security Vulnerabilities Found
Issue: The submitted code snippet is a very simple function that adds two numbers together. It does not involve any IO operations, network connections, or dynamic memory allocation, all of which are common sources of security vulnerabilities in Java. Therefore, no significant security vulnerabilities have been found in this code.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test addition with positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of adding two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No requirement for setup data, as parameters will be passed directly to the method.
  Act: Invoke the addTwoNumbers method with two positive integer parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate the summation of two positive integers.
Validation:
  This test validates if the method correctly handles addition of two positive integer numbers.
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the base functionality of addition is working as expected.


Scenario 2: Test addition with negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is intended to validate the method's handling of adding two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data setup needed.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with two negative integers.
  Assert: Validate the outcome using JUnit assertions by comparing the result against the expected negative output.
Validation:
  This test verifies if the method addTwoNumbers can correctly handle and return the sum of negative numbers.
  The importance of this test is to ensure the method can handle negative inputs and produce accurate results.


Scenario 3: Test addition with zero

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionWithZero
  Description: The test validates the method's handling when one of the inputs is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data setup needed.
  Act: Invoke the method with one parameter being zero and the other some random integer.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the outcome is equal to the non-zero integer.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles and returns the result when zero is one of the parameters.
  This is crucial as zero is a neutral element in addition and the result should equal the other operand.


Scenario 4: Test addition with two zeros

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfTwoZeros
  Description: This test is meant to check the result of the method when both input parameters are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with both parameter values being zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the outcome is zero.
Validation:
  This test asserts that the method can correctly handle and return the result when both parameters are zero.
  The importance lies in validating that the method correctly handles the neutral element of addition.
