================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Possible Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
Issue: The addition of two integers might result in an overflow if the sum is larger than what an int can hold in Java. This might lead to unexpected results.
Solution: One way to mitigate this would be to use long instead of int, or use BigInteger for arithmetic operations when dealing with really large numbers. Another approach would be to add checks for integer overflow.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: There is no guard clause or validation check on the input parameters to the function. This might not be relevant in this simple code snippet, but in general, it's a good practice to validate inputs to maintain the integrity of data and application.
Solution: Consider adding checks to validate the input parameters before using them in the function body.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Addition of two positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks the method's functionality by adding two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integer variables with positive values.
  Act: Invoke the method addTwoNumbers passing the two integers as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result obtained from the operation is the correct sum of the input values.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method correctly combines two positive numbers. This is a basic test to confirm the method's expected behavior.

Scenario 2: Addition of negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies if the method can correctly handle and add two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two integer variables with negative values.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method with the two negative integers as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the correct sum of the input values.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. This test ensures correct behavior in the presence of negative input.

Scenario 3: Addition of zero and a positive number

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndPositiveNumber
  Description: This test validates the method’s ability to add zero to a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one variable to zero and another to a positive integer.
  Act: Call addTwoNumbers method, passing the zero and positive integer as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals the positive number.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that any number added with zero should return the number itself. This tests validates that the method correctly handles the edge case of zero input.

Scenario 4: Addition of zero and a negative number

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfZeroAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test checks the method’s ability to add zero to a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one variable to zero and another to a negative integer.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method, passing the zero and negative integer as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals to the negative number.
Validation:
  The assertion proves that when a number is added with zero, the result should always be the number itself. This test applies the zero rule to negative numbers, ensuring that the rule is maintained across the number line.

Scenario 5: Addition of the maximum integer and a positive number

Details:
  TestName: testAdditionOfMaxIntegerAndPositiveNumber
  Description: This test validates the method’s ability to handle the overflow condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one variable to Integer.MAX_VALUE and another to a positive integer.
  Act: Call the addTwoNumbers method, passing the maximum integer value and positive integer as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the result is negative (indicating overflow).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to confirm that the method handles arithmetic overflow properly. This test is important, as overflow conditions can potentially lead to misleading results if not managed correctly.
