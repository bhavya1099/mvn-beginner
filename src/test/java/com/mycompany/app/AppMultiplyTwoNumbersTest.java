================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inappropriate Values
Issue: The input parameters of the method aren't checked for validity. Passing inappropriate values such as extremely large numbers may lead to unexpected results or Integer Overflow.
Solution: Check the input parameters for validity before using them. Ensure you handle boundary conditions correctly.

Vulnerability: NullPointerException
Issue: If the method is called with null objects as parameters, it will throw a NullPointerException.
Solution: Check if the passed objects are not null before using them. In this case it's not applicable as int cannot be null. But for future reference, always validate input is not null.

"""
  Scenario 1: Normal multiplication of two positive numbers

  Details:
    TestName: positiveNumberMultiplication
    Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication of two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign two positive numbers to variables a and b.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the positive integers a and b.
    Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result of the multiplication.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the method correctly multiplies two positive integers. The expected return value is the product of the two numbers. This checks the expected behavior of integer multiplication.

  Scenario 2: Multiplication of two negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: negativeNumberMultiplication
    Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication of two negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign two negative numbers to variables a and b.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the negative integers a and b.
    Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result of the multiplication.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the method correctly multiplies two negative integers. The expected return value is a positive value because the product of two negative numbers is a positive number. This checks the expected behavior of integer multiplication.

  Scenario 3: Multiplication of a positive and a negative number

  Details:
    TestName: positiveAndNegativeNumberMultiplication
    Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication of a positive and a negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign a negative number to variable a and a positive number to variable b.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the integers a and b.
    Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result of the multiplication.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the method correctly multiplies a positive and a negative integer. The expected return value is a negative number since the product of a positive number and a negative number is negative. This checks the expected behavior of integer multiplication.

  Scenario 4: Multiplication of zero with a positive number

  Details:
    TestName: zeroAndPositiveNumberMultiplication
    Description: This test is meant to check the multiplication of zero and a positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign 0 to variable a and a positive number to variable b.
    Act: Invoke the multiplyTwoNumbers method with the integers a and b.
    Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result of the multiplication.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the method correctly returns 0 when a number is multiplied with zero. This checks the expected behavior of integer multiplication.
